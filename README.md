# vocafex

vocafex is an audio processing software.
currently vocafex is still in development and there is no any useful documentation yet. 

these are all the features that we want to achieve:
- Audio Track (enable multiple audio input such as microphone, wav file, etc)
- Audio Mixer (mixing all input and combine it into one output)
- Sound FX (reverb, chorus, distortion, noise cancelling, etc)
- Audio Pipeline (pipelining all audio stream from and to each step such as input -> processing -> sink)
